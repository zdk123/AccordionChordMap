# Accordion Chord Map

Based on the python script originally from [Mellowood.ca](https://mellowood.ca/music/accordion/alternate-chords.html)

> One big problem with accordion, especially when playing jazz and Latin, is that the chord buttons of left hand side are rather limiting. For one thing, the chord types are limited to major, minor, seventh and diminished. And, further, each chord has only three sounding notes (seventh and diminished drop the fifth).

> There really aren't problems in this world, just opportunities for solutions! The limited chord set of the Stradella bass gives the player the choice to add the missing notes with the creative use of the single bass buttons, adding treble notes, and even the pressing of multiple chord buttons at the same time. Really, it's just a matter of how flexible (and big) your hands are.

## This repo

This is a web application project that provides alternative chord mappings for the Stradella bass accordion. Built using a combination of replit and elbow grease - the app uses a React frontend and Express for the backend.
